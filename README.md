The objective of this project is to create a csv File Manager and Interpreter, and a basic Version Control System. The bash file submission.sh implements the functions. Most of the program files are written in bash script, while some use awk and python.
The code for each utility is present in a different file. submission.sh contains commands to execute the utilities based on the arguments given to it. The various commands can be run using:
”bash submission.sh <command> [option] [argument(s)]”.
The code has been modularised by using a seperate file for each command.
Please look at report.pdf for further details.
